Dataset Chicago Taxi Trips in BigQuery : https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/city-of-chicago-public-data/chicago-taxi-trips

This dataset includes taxi trips from 2013 to the present, reported to the City of Chicago in its role as a regulatory agency. To protect privacy but allow for aggregate analyses, the Taxi ID is consistent for any given taxi medallion number but does not show the number, Census Tracts are suppressed in some cases, and times are rounded to the nearest 15 minutes. Due to the data reporting process, not all trips are reported but the City believes that most are. For more information about this dataset and how it was created, see this post  on the City of Chicago's blog.

This public dataset is hosted in Google BigQuery and is included in BigQuery's 1TB/mo of free tier processing. This means that each user receives 1TB of free BigQuery processing every month, which can be used to run queries on this public dataset. Watch this short video to learn how to get started quickly using BigQuery to access public datasets. 

Project completed in September-October 2023.
